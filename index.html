            <label class="while-text">A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million (10<sup>8</sup>) 
                 stars to giants with one hundred trillion (10<sup>14</sup>) stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.
                <br>Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,spiral, or irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers.
                 The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant galaxy observed.
